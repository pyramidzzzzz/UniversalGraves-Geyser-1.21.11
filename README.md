# UniversalGraves-Geyser-1.21.11

A "fork" (if you can even call it that, all I did was change some version numbers) of the Fabric mod that adds Bedrock Edition (Geyser/Floodgate) compatibility to [Universal Graves](https://modrinth.com/mod/universal-graves) that adds support for Minecraft Java 1.21.11. Not that well tested so beware of bugs and the like.
I don't plan on maintaining this as it is just a quick solution for people who *really* want to play on 1.21.11.
