# UniversalGraves-Geyser

A Fabric mod that adds Bedrock Edition (Geyser/Floodgate) compatibility to [Universal Graves](https://modrinth.com/mod/universal-graves).

## Features

- **Visual Grave Overlays**: Bedrock players see skull blocks, floating text displays, and item previews at grave locations
- **GUI Translation**: Replaces Polymer's custom player head buttons with recognizable vanilla items in the grave UI
- **Grave Protection**: Prevents graves from being destroyed during slow server loads
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Overlays are properly removed when graves are collected or destroyed

## Why This Mod?

Universal Graves uses [Polymer](https://github.com/Patbox/polymer) to render custom blocks and GUIs. While this works great for Java Edition players, Bedrock Edition players connecting via Geyser see:
- Invisible grave blocks (Polymer virtual blocks)
- Steve heads instead of custom GUI buttons

This addon fixes both issues by:
1. Sending real block states and fake entities to Bedrock players
2. Intercepting GUI packets and translating custom heads to vanilla items

## Requirements

- **Minecraft**: 1.21.9 - 1.21.10
- **Fabric Loader**: 0.14.0+
- **Fabric API**
- **Universal Graves**: 3.9.1+
- **Floodgate** (recommended): For detecting Bedrock players

2. Install [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)
3. Install [Universal Graves](https://modrinth.com/mod/universal-graves)
4. Install [Geyser](https://geysermc.org/) and [Floodgate](https://wiki.geysermc.org/floodgate/)

cd UniversalGraves-Geyser

# Build the mod
./gradlew build

# The jar will be in build/libs/
```

## How It Works

### Grave Overlays
For Bedrock players within 48 blocks of a grave:
- A skeleton skull block is rendered at the grave position
- An invisible armor stand displays grave information (owner, items, XP, timers)
- An invisible fox holds a preview of the first item in the grave

### GUI Translation
When a Bedrock player opens the grave UI:
- Custom player head buttons are replaced with vanilla items
- "Next" → Arrow
- "Previous" → Arrow
- "Close" → Barrier
- "Collect" → Chest
- And more...

## Configuration

Currently all settings are hardcoded. Configuration file support may be added in a future version.

| Setting | Value | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Render Distance | 48 blocks | Maximum distance to show overlays |
| Update Rate | 5 ticks (0.25s) | How often overlays are updated |
| Respawn Interval | 30 seconds | How often entities are respawned |

## Compatibility

- **Universal Graves**: Required, tested with 3.9.1+
- **Geyser/Floodgate**: Required for Bedrock player detection
- **Other mods**: Should be compatible with most server-side mods
